## 📌 Project Overview

Healthcare costs can be difficult to anticipate. This app helps simulate how factors like **age**, **BMI**, **smoking habits**, and **region** affect insurance premiums using a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** trained on real data.

It’s a simplified version of how actuaries and pricing analysts estimate individual risk — brought to life using Python and Streamlit.

## 🧠 Features

- Interactive sliders and dropdowns for input
- Real-time prediction of insurance charges
- Feature engineering: creates a `high_risk` indicator for smokers with high BMI
- Trained on the [Kaggle Medical Cost dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Loads `insurance.csv`
2. One-hot encodes categorical features
3. Adds a custom `high_risk` feature
4. Trains a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** on-the-fly (to avoid .pkl issues)
5. Accepts user input → returns predicted insurance charges instantly
